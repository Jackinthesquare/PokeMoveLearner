PLEASE READ SO YOU DON'T HURT YOURSELF OR BREAK THE FILE!!1!

This file "tries" to replicate an aspect of the Pokemon Rom game where the player tries to teach a Pokemon a move.

v.1.0.0 
-At this time, player can select a Kanto starter and teach him/her any moves as long as it is valid in Generation 1. At this time, player input does not take capitalization characters so input must be in lower case. If move is valid, move will be registered as one of the four moves just like in the game while flushing out the oldest move if new input exceeds four moves.

Limitations!!!
-Only 3 Pokemons are available and they are Bulbasaur, Charmander, Squirtle
-No restrictions on learning moves(i.e., level,type,compatibility requirements) and duplication moves is possible: go crazy on that "fire blast" and burn your opponent!
